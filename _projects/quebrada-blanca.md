The Quebrada Blanca mine is located in Region I in northern Chile at an
elevation of 4,400 metres, approximately 240 kilometres southeast of the
city of Iquique and 1,500 kilometres from Santiago. Mine personnel live
in a camp facility, and the majority commute from large population
centres, including Iquique and Santiago.

Teck owns a 76.5% interest in the mine. The remaining interest is owned
by Inversiones Mineras S.A., 13.5%, and Empresa Nacional de Minera, 10%.

Quebrada Blanca is an open pit operation, which leaches the ore to
produce copper cathodes via a SX-EW process. Copper cathode is trucked
to Iquique for shipment to clients.
