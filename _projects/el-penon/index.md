title: El Peñón
---


Located in northern Chile, El Peñón is a high grade underground
gold-silver mine with a 4,200 tonnes per day agitated leaching /counter
current decantation (CCD) and Merrill-Crowe plant. Since production
began in 2000, continuing exploration has established a track record of
replacing ounces mined. Positive exploration results continue to
indicate potential for extending the mine’s life.

  Current exploration is focused on establishing mineral reserves at new discoveries at Dorada Sur and Dorada Oeste, Fortuna Este and Bonanza West. The continued success of the program will lead to improved production, provide mining flexibility and ultimately increase mine life. At the Pampa Augusta victoria vein system, which is near-surface and easily accessible, development has commenced and an open pit mining operation is expected to supplement production from underground areas
