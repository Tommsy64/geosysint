Golden China's 95% owned Beyinhar gold project lies within the Inner\
Mongolia Fold Belt Region, a productive orogenic belt hosting several
skarn,\
shear-hosted, orogenic/mesothermal veins and porphyry Cu-Au deposits.
This\
Fold Belt region hosts the world-class Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold deposit\
(1.15 billion tonnes @ 1.27 % Cu and 0.48 g/t gold), and CSH 217
shear-hosted\
gold deposit (83 million tonnes @ 0.82 g/t gold). Inner Mongolia is a
province\
of the People's Republic of China.

The Beyinhar project is well supplied by existing infrastructure and\
services. The site is located 365 km from Hohhot, the Provincial capital
and\
has a bitumen road passing within 1km of the deposit. A new 110KVa power
line\
has recently been constructed within 7km of the site and a potential
water\
source lies some 30km to the NW. The town of Sonid Youqi, comprising
some\
16,000 persons, is located only 50km to the south west. The large city
and\
airport at Xilinhot is only a 2 hour drive to the north east.

The Beyinhar gold property covers an exploration license of
approximately\
49.45 km2, with a 1.5 km2 mining lease inside this exploration permit
area.
