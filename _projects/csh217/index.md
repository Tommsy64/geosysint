Chang Shan Hao (217) deposit, commonly abbreviated to CSH 217 is an open
pit operation that utilises conventional mining methods. Ore is
processed using heap-leaching methods. Expansion of heap leaching and
processing system in year 2014 enable doubling of mine capacity to
60kt/d. The gold production is expected to increase to 260 koz per annum
in year 2016.

CSH is a conventional open-pit, heap-leach, gold-mining operation mining
a large, bulk-tonnage, low-grade gold deposit. It is located in Inner
Mongolia of China, approximately 210 km northwest of the city of Baotou.

Its principal product is gold dore bars with silver as a by-product,
recently expanded to a processing capacity of 60,000 tpd. Current (2012)
open pit proven+probable reserves are 213 million tonnes averaging 0.59
g/t gold totalling 4.08 million ounces of gold at 0.28 g/t cutoff gold
grade. Measured and Indicated Resources are 262 million tonnes,
averaging 0.60 g/t gold totalling 5.05 million ounces of gold at 0.28
g/t cutoff gold grade (inclusive of the stated reserves). Life Of Mine
(LOM) is 11 years.
