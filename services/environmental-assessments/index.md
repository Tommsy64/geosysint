title: Environmental Assessments

Environmental assessment is the term used for the assessment of the environmental consequences (positive and negative) of a project prior to the decision to move forward, which is described in an Environmental Impact Assessment document (EIA). Environmental assessments are generally governed by laws, regulations, and administrative procedures regarding public participation and documentation of decision making set up by each country within which the project takes place, and in some cases may be subject to judicial review.

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made." EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to account for environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.

GeoSystems International, Inc. will work hand in hand with other consulting companies for mining companies executing Environmental Impact assessments under the laws of the country where the operation lies. GeoSystemsâ€™ expertise is with Site Assessment, spatial prediction of water, soil, and air contamination, and the predicted generation of new contaminants, such as in the case of the potential for Acid Rock Drainage (ARD).
