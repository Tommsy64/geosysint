Much geologic information is gathered at different stages of a mining project.  This information is used to understand the genesis of the mineral deposit, the distribution of mineralized rock, and to develop exploration criteria for increasing resources.
 
The level of detail in the geologic description of a deposit steadily increases as the project advances through its different stages.  Economic factors are the most important ones affecting the decision of whether or not to proceed with further geologic investigations; therefore, most geologic work is orientated towards finding more mineral resources, and to some extent to more detailed general exploration.
 
Not all geologic information is relevant to resource estimation.  Geologic investigations for resource development should concentrate on defining mineralization controls.  Certain geologic details and descriptions are more useful for exploration in that they do not describe a specific mineralization control, but rather provide guidelines for mineral occurrences.
 
GeoSystems’ Independent Associates understand that modeling the geological variables that represent mineralization controls is key to providing a successful resource model. This definition and modeling of mineralization (geologic) domains leads to the decision of how to pool information within a specific zone within the deposit, within certain boundaries, or the deposit as a whole. Decisions are based on oxidation zones, lithologies, alterations, or structural boundaries. The domains cannot be too small; otherwise, there are too few data for reliable statistical description and inference. The domains cannot be too big; otherwise, the data could likely be subset into more geologically homogeneous subdivisions. The mixing of different types of mineralization should be kept to a minimum to avoid smearing grades across geologic boundaries.

GeoSystems’ Independent Associates are familiar with most commonly used software packages which have been developed to assist mining, petroleum, and environmental companies in building solids models. Software packages are often able to build and visualize 3D models quickly, as well as dynamically updated when additional information becomes available. Maps, cross and plan sections, volumetric analysis, and modeling of geologic features are all possible at impressive scales and speeds. These 3D solids models provide much more efficient communication to clients, management, shareholders, and partners.
