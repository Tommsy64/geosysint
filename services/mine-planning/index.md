title: Mine Planning
---

In its broadest definition, mine planning begins with the process of optimization of the extraction of the identified and modeled resources, whether through a pit optimization software if near surface, or the definition of underground zones or stopes if deeper mineralization is considered. <br>

The estimated grades in the resources are converted into dollar values applying relevant pricing, recovery, and cost information to the existing models. The purpose of the process is to maximize profits by digging as much as possible to optimize value extraction. The process takes into account appropriate economic, geometallurgical, geotechnical, hydrogeological, and environmental considerations. <br>
Our services cover support for audits and reviews; scoping studies, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies; detailed mine design and layouts; production scheduling equipment selection; and operating and capital cost estimation.  <br>
GeoSystems International, Inc. associates apply a rigorous mine planning methodology that results in a life-of-mine plan and economic model which identifies the best cut-off strategy, mining depth, size, and scale of operation.  <br>
As with other areas of work, GeoSystems’ can integrate its Associates with the client’s team to provide additional manpower and resources to achieve quality results within the project timeframe. <br>
