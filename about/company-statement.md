Formed in 1994, GeoSystems International, Inc. (GSI) is an independent, international consulting
practice that provides sharp advice along with solutions to clients. Mainly working in mining projects,
GSI offers services from exploration through feasibility, mine planning, and production.


Mining and prospecting are not just a matter of luck and hard work; there is specialized knowledge
that must be learned. GSI’s approach to problem-solving and project development is based on
working with independent associates to build the right team for the job. GSI contracts with leading
specialists in every field required, relying on sound project management and the individual’s wealth
of experience to seamless integrate all services provided. The company has international experience
and practice in geology and resources, reserves, mining, operational optimization, due diligence,
feasibility studies and internal reviews.


Among GSI’s many clients are many of the world&#39;s major and medium-sized metal and industrial
mineral mining, as well as large and small exploration companies. GSI is independent of all
companies and projects, holding no equity in any project, and is strictly a consultancy provider. This
allows GSI to provide clients objective support on crucial issues while ensuring no conflicts of
interest.


GSI contributes to sustainable mining by providing contamination and risk assessments related to
mining activities. GSI also provides support for Environmental Impact Statements and soil, water, and
air contamination assessments for all other industries. There is always danger in mining to its workers
and its destruction of the areas in which it is carried out; but without metals no other activity is
possible: if it cannot be grown, it has to be mined.


GSI has many years’ experience in developing training seminars, workshops, and short courses in
basic and advanced mining and environmental geostatistics; resource modeling; grade control
methods; international standards for resource classification and resource public statements; and
conditional simulations. These can be customized as part of a Client’s internal Technology Transfer
program, or public, as part of Continuing Education programs. GSI’s associates currently contribute
to the Postgraduate programs of two Universities in South America.


GSI also develops custom-made software for specific Client’s needs. While this development does not
result in commercial applications, they provide the Client with solutions in specific cases where
commercial applications are not available.
